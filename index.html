      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>An aspiring developer, I started my coding journey in 2022. I had no idea if I would enjoy it - or indeed be any good at it - but when I had a go at learning some html on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> W3Schools</a>, I found it surprisingly fun!</p>

      <p>Fast forward to now and I have learned the basics of html, CSS and Javascript, along with some C# thrown in for good measure. I've yet to decide which area to specialise in but the main thing for me at the moment is that I'm really enoying the learning process and creating my own content.</p>

      <p>What I really didn't expect when I started coding was just how much I would enjoy it. Something that I'd previously found totally incomprehensible started to make sense! And the best bit is the satisfaction of writing code that works well and being able to say, "I made that!".</p>

      <p>Below is video from Scrimba, which I found to be a really useful resource during the Intro to Digital course.</p>
